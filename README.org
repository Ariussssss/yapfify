Yapfify uses yapf to format a Python buffer. It can be called explicitly on a
certain buffer, but more conveniently it can be used to automatically format
a buffer before saving it.

Because YAPF will sometimes do things to your code, you may not agree with, a
toggle is provided to easily turn it of using `yapfify-toggle-on-save`.

Installation:

Add yapfify.el to your load-path.

To automatically format all Python buffers before saving, add the function
yapfify-buffer to python-mode-hook:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook yapfify-format-buffer)
#+END_SRC
